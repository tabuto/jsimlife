# ZLifeDna #

Dna object contains the Zlife Genes:

  1. _dnaParam_: the Dna random parameter simulate Genetics mutation
  1. _energy_: actual energy of the cell
  1. _maxEnergy_: max energy for the cell
  1. _hornyEnergy_: the minimum energy needs to riproduce
  1. _hungryEnergy_: the energy below one the Cell is hungry
  1. _lifeCycle_: the number of lifeCycle before the cell Die.
  1. _metabolism_: the energy needs for every moving of the cell. this value is subtract to energy
  1. _boredSpeed_: the speed when the cell is in BORED state
  1. _riproductionEnergy_: the energy cell spend to riproduce itself
  1. _hungrySpeed_: the speed when cell is hungry
  1. _hornySpeed_: the speed when cell is horny
  1. _scarySpeed_: the speed when cell is scary (NOT YET USED!)
  1. _radius_: the radius of the cell
  1. _R_: the red color's component of this cell
  1. _G_: the green color's component of this cell
  1. _B_: the blue color's component of this cell
  1. _ageFactor_: energy percent subtract to max energy for each life cycle cell spends
